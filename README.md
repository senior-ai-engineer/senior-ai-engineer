# Hi, I'm Senior AI & Full-Stack Engineer 👋  

Building reliable, production‑grade AI systems

---

## 🚀 What I Do

- Design and ship **AI‑native products**: copilots, agents, and intelligent workflows that people actually use in real systems.  
- Build **LLM systems end‑to‑end**: retrieval (RAG), tools, memory, and evaluation wired into production backends and frontends.  
- Focus on **reliability and observability**: tracing, guardrails, tests, and clear failure modes instead of fragile demos.

I care about AI that *does something useful*—drives decisions, automates work, and fits cleanly into existing products and infrastructure.

## 🧩 Backend & Infrastructure

[![Backend & Infra](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=nodejs,ts,fastapi,express,postgres,redis,docker,nginx,git)](https://skillicons.dev)  

**Backend Focus:**  
APIs • Data Pipelines • Queues • Observability • CI/CD  

- Node.js / TypeScript, Python (FastAPI / Express)  
- SQL (Postgres) and key‑value / cache (Redis)  
- Containerization with Docker, reverse proxy (Nginx)  
- Git‑based workflows, automated testing, and deployments

## 🎨 Frontend & Product

[![Frontend](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=react,nextjs,tailwind,html,css,js)](https://skillicons.dev)  

**Frontend Focus:**  
AI‑first UX • Dashboards • Copilot Interfaces • Design Systems  

- React / Next.js for AI‑driven apps  
- Tailwind CSS for rapid, consistent UI  
- Chat interfaces, inline copilots, admin panels

## 🛠 Tools & Platforms

[![Tools](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=vscode,github,gitlab,vercel,aws,gcp,linux)](https://skillicons.dev)  

**Ecosystem:**  
DevEx • Cloud • Collaboration  

- VS Code, GitHub / GitLab workflows  
- Deployments on Vercel / AWS / GCP  
- Linux‑based development and server environments

---

## 🧱 How I Work

- Start from the **real workflow and constraints**, then choose the right models and architecture.  
- Design **simple, composable systems** that are easy to reason about and extend.  
- Ship iteratively with **tests, observability, and clear interfaces** so teams can trust and build on the system.

If you need AI features that are **robust enough for production** and aligned with real product goals, that’s where I’m most effective.
